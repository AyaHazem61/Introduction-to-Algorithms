### **Algorithm** 

- Well-defined computational procedure 'sequence of steps' that takes set of values ***input*** and produces set of values ***output***
- Tool to solve a specified computational problem

### **Common problems that the book will cover**
- Sorting
- Finding shortest path
- Finding longest similar subsequence between two squences
- Ordering **n** mechanical parts such that each part doesn't appear before any other part uses it
- Finding the convex hull of **n** points 'smallest convex polygon that  contains all points'

### **Data Structure**
- Way to store and organize data to faciliate acess and modification
